# Object-Oriented Programming
### July 15, 16, day 14-15

- The creation of classes is literally *the* abstraction boundary

## Definition of a class
- a **class** define a new data type for other programs to use
- Examples we've seen so far are Vectors, Maps, Graphs, Queue, GPoints (not GridLocations)
- Every class has two parts
	- the **interface** = the abstraction boundary, the operations that is available to the user (the documentation)
	- the **implementation** = the actual background code that users don't need to see
- **Encapsultation** = the process of grouping relevant information together and defining where that information is available (**public/private**)

- main difference with structs is that structs by default have public members, classes are private by default

- we can use the class as a *blueprint* to create **instances** of it, called **objects**
	- `Vector<int> vec;` creates an instance of the Vector class

## Writing a class
- three parts;
	- Member variables = variables stored within the class, usually not available outside the class
	- Member functions = functions you can call on an object (when you call it later, the object will be the implicit parameter)
	- Constructor = the function called to create an object
- two files;
	- header and implementation files will have the same root/name for convention
	- write the `[classname].h` header file = defining the interface
		- every member var and function must be defined in the header file
		- include the `#pragma once`	preprocessing directive, makes sure that it won't re-included your code multiple times in a project if you have multiple `#include` calls for this class that you're writing throughout the project (without this, the seperate include calls will try and create two classes with your name and won't compile, like making two vars of the same name) 
		- - inclue the `public:` and `private:` portions of the implementation. public will include all the member functions that you can call on functions, private will include the (privated) member variables (it's good practice to keep all vars private, private helper methods can also be kept here)

		- if you have methods that act as accessor methods and don't change the state, you add `const` to the end of the function header (both in the header and implementation files)

	- write the actual `[classname].cpp` implementation file
		- include the header file at the top
		- define all your methods, using the *scope resolution operator* to make sure the method is linked to this specific class's header file

		- ![[Pasted image 459.png]]
		- write the constructor
			- if you don't define a constructor, there will be an *implicit default constructor* that initializes all the member variables to each var's type's default value
			- constructor still needs to be defined in the header file as well
			- the function header in the .cpp file will be `[className]::[className]`
			- the this keyword is written as `this->`, and works just about the same way as in java
				- `this.` is something different, apparently...
				- you can call functions within the same class as you write other functions, and the "current" object will automatically be the implicit variable. but, to be clear or to avoid name confusions, you can include this here too

- EXAMPLE: Bank Account
	- you want to be very careful about limiting money that can be transfered/how the account value changes (which is why that var should be private!)
