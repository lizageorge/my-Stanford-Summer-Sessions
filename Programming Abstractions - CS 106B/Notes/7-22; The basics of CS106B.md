# The basics of CS106B
### June 22, 2020 - first class!

- Compuational thinking is the use of critical thinking and the creation of computational symptoms - it is more than just CS education
	- Similar to the relation between literary thinking and writing -

## Abstractions
- = simplifying a problem/idea by leaving out certain details to create a model easier to use and reuse.
- [] binary is an abstraction of the electrical ativity happening in the computer board. programming languages are abstractions through which we communicate to computers - we don't have to think through binary. data structures and functions and algorithms are abstractions of simple structures - the history of computing the *the building of layers of abstractions*
- [] a user interface in an abstraction that allows you to use a technology without having to think about/through all the back end processes.

- "crossing the abstraction boundary" can be compared to moving past a cookbook to make your own recipes

## Why C++?
- C++ is a compiled language (= a compiler will translate to machine code, which is then run. As opposed to an interpeted language like python or js, which is just read line-bt-line)
- gives access to lower-level tools like computer memory
- there are stanford c++ libraries we can use!
