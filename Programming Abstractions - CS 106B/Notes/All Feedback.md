### Assign1 (Functionality: +, Style: âœ“+)
- *functionality*
	- function decomposition
		- *functions shouldn't have an extended functionality. Make sure that anything too long is plit up among different functions*
		- but don't get too specific either, and check for pre-existing functionality/helper methods before writing one (`s[0] = toUpperCase(originalSurname[0])` vs. writing out a switchFirstChar function that uses substrings)
	- don't worry about keeping edge-case checks out of loops for efficiency. it's not that much of a difference, and it could be clearer within the loop
	- :) caught edge cases well
	- :) tested well
- *style*
	- *in-line comments should be short. if anything is too long, keep them in a seperate file, maybe even multi-line*
	- space everything out (`m* pow(2, p-1)` vs `m * pow(2, p - 1)`)
	- (from lecture) include function prototypes for all of your functions, even if they're in a convenient order, for readability
- *submition*
	- file header comments should include a little bit on what the functions within do
	- writing exactly that a submission is an extension, which submission is normal, etc. is appreciated
	- extensions aren't graded
