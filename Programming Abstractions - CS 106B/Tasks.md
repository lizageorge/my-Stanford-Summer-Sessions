# Tasks for Programming Abstractions
### Color: Purple

- [ ] catch up on last lecture, life after cs106b, first half
- content confusions:
	- [ ] check the difference bween pass-by-value and pass-by-reference in  java (primitive vs non-primitve data types)
	- [ ] i asked this during lecture but honestly didn't get it...why does using a forloop to iterate through the index instead of passing it through the method allow for identical possibilities to be searched?
- optional practice;
	- [ ] section 4 practice (esp the "Circle of life" problem)
	- [ ] section 3 practice
	- [ ] knapsack problem, but return the actual combination of items, not total possible value
	- [ ] generalized tower of hanoi method from lecture 6 (on ed) (code in sublime)




## Questions
- [ ] do function header comments have to follow a certain format, like standard function headers in java?
- [ ] weird 'not accessible' thing in debugger, can't see any sets ![[Pasted image 264.png]], ![[Pasted image 265.png]]
- [ ]  i asked this during lecture but honestly didn't get it...why does using a forloop to iterate through the index instead of passing it through the method allow for identical possibilities to be searched?
- [ ] is O(n n^2) a thing? or does that just simplify to O(n^2)?
- [ ] can a backtracking problem be a backtracking problem if it doesn't have an unchoose step? (midterm EC)

- [ ] things work in debugger but not when running normally

## Assign 6
- [ ] warmup
	- [x] saq, 
		- [x] flattening
		- [x] optimal
	- [x] code, 
		- [x] createexampletree
		- [x] deallocatetree
		- [x] areequal
	- [ ] huffman encoding
		- [x] decode
		- [x] unflatten
			- [ ] more tests?
		- [x] decompress
		- [x] encode
			- [ ] fillMap - more tests?
			- [ ] more tests?
		- [x] flatten
			- [ ] more tests?
		- [x] buildHuffmanTree
		- [x] compress
		- [ ] end-to-end tests
- [ ] is it ok that i've been using tree->one== nullptr to check for char nodes?
- [ ] is creating a map of the entire tree for encode text the right thing to do?
- [ ] should i be writing more tests for all the helper functions?

## Final Project
- [ ] check guidelines
- timeline:
	- Week of 7/20: Read the project guidelines and look through the provided example project writeup. Start brainstorming ideas for the problem that you want to work on and pick a topic we've covered in the class so far that you want to improve on. start working on a first draft of the problem writeup and at least one draft solution to the problem.

	- Week of 7/27: Talk with an SL, Trip, Nick, or Kylie during LaIR or OH this week to get feedback on your problem. Finish writing up answers to the required questions, as well as any alternate solutions.

	- Week of 8/3: Finish polishing your project report and put the finishing touches together. The project report is due on August 9th.
		- keep in mind you'll loose half this week to studying for 193c finals!

	- Week of 8/10: Prepare for your presentation to your section leader, practicing your teaching and explanations skills! Presentations will take place from August 13th to August 16th. 
		- keep in mind you'll loose half this week to school, and probably the other half to studying for finals!
