# Tasks for Programming Abstractions

- content confusions:
	- [ ] check the difference bween pass-by-value and pass-by-reference (in c++ and java)
- optional practice;
	- [ ] section 2 assignments...Twice bonus
		- [ ] (diagnostic next week will have problems similar to section problems)
	- [ ] generalized tower of hanoi method from lecture 6 (on ed) (code in sublime)
 
### Color: Purple


## Questions
- [ ] do function header comments have to follow a certain format, like standard function headers in java?
- [ ] (QT Creator) is there a way to jump from breakpoint to the next breakpoint without having to step-over again and again (like in intellij)?
- [x] do student test cases have to be listed seperately at bottom of the file 
- ASSIGN 1:
	- [ ] should i add tests that compare my paths to provided solutions?

	
##  Per Assingment - Assign 2
- [x] part 0 /warmup
- [ ] maze
	- [ ] basic
		- [x] generateValidMoves
		- [x] checkSolution
		- [ ] solveMaze
			- [ ] should i add tests that compare my paths to provided solutions?
			- [ ] why isn't the expect equal in my solvemaze test for impossible maze reporting? in simple test, only the expect-error call shows up
		- [x] readMazeFile
		- [ ] header comments
	- [ ] read over, submit
	- [ ] extra
		- [ ] more tests on generateValidMoves, more cases per test?
		- [ ] more tests on checkSolution, more cases per test?
		- [ ] fancy error messages for checkSolution
		- [ ] (proper extension) look into generating valid mazes
		- [ ] (proper extension) compare with different search algorithms
		- [ ] somehow make solvemaze a little more efficient, test with timing...
			- [ ] different algorithm entirely?
			- [ ] test south and east neighbors first
		- [ ] something...with non perfect mazes?
- [ ] search engine
	- [ ] basic
		- [x] clean token
		- [x] readDoc
		- [ ] buildIndex
			- [ ] more tests?
		- [ ] findQueryMatches
		- [ ] searchEngine
	- [ ] read over, submit
	- [ ] extra
