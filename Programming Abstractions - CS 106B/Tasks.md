# Tasks for Programming Abstractions

- content confusions:
	- [ ] check the difference bween pass-by-value and pass-by-reference (in c++ and java)
	- [ ] trip said " O(log(n)) is the fastest possible runtime for search algorithms. Why is that?"
	- [ ] i asked this during lecture but honestly didn't get it...why does using a forloop to iterate through the index instead of passing it through the method allow for identical possibilities to be searched?
	- [ ] why does countZeroSumSubsets from asisgn3 part 2 warmup work??
- optional practice;
	- [ ] section 3 practice
	- [ ] section 2 assignments...Twice bonus
		- [ ] (diagnostic next week will have problems similar to section problems)
	- [ ] knapsack problem, but return the actual combination of items, not total possible value
	- [ ] generalized tower of hanoi method from lecture 6 (on ed) (code in sublime)

## Questions
- [ ] do function header comments have to follow a certain format, like standard function headers in java?
- [ ] weird 'not accessible' thing in debugger, can't see any sets ![[Pasted image 264.png]], ![[Pasted image 265.png]]
- [ ] ASSIGN 3
	- [ ] is the behavior of quitting after a certain number of stack frames (stackoverflow with the "unexpectedly finished" message or whatever) unique to QT or would my PC do it too?
	- [ ] help on question 14
