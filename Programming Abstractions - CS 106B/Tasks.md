# Tasks for Programming Abstractions

- content confusions:
	- [ ] check the difference bween pass-by-value and pass-by-reference in  java (primitive vs non-primitve data types)
	- [ ] i asked this during lecture but honestly didn't get it...why does using a forloop to iterate through the index instead of passing it through the method allow for identical possibilities to be searched?
- optional practice;
	- [ ] section 4 practice
	- [ ] section 3 practice
	- [ ] knapsack problem, but return the actual combination of items, not total possible value
	- [ ] generalized tower of hanoi method from lecture 6 (on ed) (code in sublime)

## Questions
- [ ] do function header comments have to follow a certain format, like standard function headers in java?
- [ ] weird 'not accessible' thing in debugger, can't see any sets ![[Pasted image 264.png]], ![[Pasted image 265.png]]
- [ ]  i asked this during lecture but honestly didn't get it...why does using a forloop to iterate through the index instead of passing it through the method allow for identical possibilities to be searched?
- [ ] is O(n n^2) a thing? or does that just simplify to O(n^2)?
- [ ] can a backtracking problem be a backtracking problem if it doesn't have an unchoose step? (midterm EC)
