# All Proof-writing Feedback

## Intuition
- Always work off of concepts that are *already* proven, not your intuition, and not on outside knowledge
	- Pset1 Checkpoint, problem 3; for modular arithmetic proofs we were relying on our prior definitions of what "mod" means, but we don't have any proof yet that remainders have to be unique to pairs of dividends and divisors.
- Be very careful on where you use the word "abitrary"

## Execution
- Always scope and introduce all variables 
	- When giving examples, give clear and specific examples
		- when giving examples of sets, give example values to the sets
		- use integers instead of letters for specific examples
- You should specify what is is that you are trying to prove and what you are assuming. The first sentence of a proof is ideally something like "We will prove..."
- you should always state exactly what your *assuming* in a proof - usually the antecedent of an implication, etc.
