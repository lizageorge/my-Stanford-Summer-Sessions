# All Proof-writing Feedback

## Intuition
- Always work off of concepts that are *already* proven, not your intuition, and not on outside knowledge
	- Pset1 Checkpoint, problem 3; for modular arithmetic proofs we were relying on our prior definitions of what "mod" means, but we don't have any proof yet that remainders have to be unique to pairs of dividends and divisors.
- Be very careful on where you use the word "abitrary"

## Execution
- Always scope and introduce all variables 
	- When giving examples, give clear and specific examples
		- when giving examples of sets, give example values to the sets
		- use integers instead of letters for specific examples
- You should specify what is is that you are trying to prove and what you are assuming. The first sentence of a proof is ideally something like "We will prove..."
- you should always state exactly what your *assuming* in a proof - usually the antecedent of an implication, etc.

## Readability, Style


## Practice Tests
- Practice Midterm #1 - 27/48 ahhhh (this might gain more with partial credit)
	- problem one - 11/12
		- oftentimes very wordy, and you repeat definitions (say "In order to prove this, we need to show that ..." instead of "In other words...")
		- but spot on logic, and good on following the guide's template for equivalence relations
	- problem two -?? maybe 2/12
		- i could not answer this, even in my second shot..
		- good to notice that both directions of the implication have to be proven
		- remember, when proving an implication, you don't have to start at the antecedent and work your way to the consequent. You just have to prove that, if the antecedent is assumed true, the consequent is true. 
	- problem three - 8??/12
		- logic for first half was good, explanation was wonky
		- i had a different logic process for second part...
		- ^ same for third part. idk if it even works
	- problem four - 6/12 
		- careful to fully define all elements (incl with key properties for assumptions)
		- again don't repeat definitions, apply them to state what you need to prove
		- part i. had good logic, ok explanation
		- part ii was almost entirely wrong - didn't use correct definition of injective, only the definition of a function
		- also remember to use template for proving subsets
