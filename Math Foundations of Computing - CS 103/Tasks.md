# Tasks for Mathematical Foundations of Computing
### Color: Blue

- [ ] Finish going through proofwriting checklist

- lecture catch ups
	- [ ] go over 7/15 lecture second half (pigeonhole principle)
	- [ ] go over beginning over 7-17 lecture (induction)
	- [ ] go over second half of 7/24 lecture omg (NHAs, regular languages)
	- [ ] (not needed for final) watch the last lecture, complexity theory

- extra/clarified learning
	- [ ] guide to self-reference
	- [ ] guide to the lava diagram

- concept confusions
	- [ ] the relationship between universal statements, implication and the and operator
		- (from guide to negations) ![[Pasted image 238.png]]
		- (from notes 6/29) ![[Pasted image 239.png]]
	- [ ] i don't get what more is needed to define vars/which var needs to be defined
		- ![[Pasted image 608.png]]
		- same for pset 4, problem 5.5.



- grading feedback
	- [ ] i don't really understand the feedback i recieved for last part of midterm...
		- "Forward direction: You should instantiate player p explicitly by using "consider", "let", etc. Also, you should structure the proof so to prove that any player p is a tournament champion rather than start out by assuming that they are and then check the "requirements".
		- but this was on a proof for biconditional...i think? So for the first part, I proved that any arbitrary p in an RPS tournament is a champion...

	- [ ] regrading pset 4?
		- [ ] wtf happened in problem 2...i don't quite get the feedback
	- [ ] regrading pset 3?
		- [ ] 6.iii we messed up the intuition, but shouldn't we still get partial credit for execution or readability? (like we did in 5.ii - messed up intuition, but got partial for readibility ) - max +2 oof no nwm


- [ ] "How to read and write proofs" by daniel solow (not necessary)

- extra practice
	- [ ] ec problems from pset3
	- [ ] ec problems from pset 4
