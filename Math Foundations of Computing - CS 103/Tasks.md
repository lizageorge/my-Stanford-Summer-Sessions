# Tasks for Mathematical Foundations of Computing
### Color: Blue

- [ ] Finish going through proofwriting checklist

- lecture catch ups
	- [ ] go over 7/15 lecture second half (pigeonhole principle)
	- [ ] go over beginning over 7-17 lecture (induction)
	- [ ] go over second half of 7/24 lecture omg (NHAs, regular languages)

- [ ] i don't really understand the feedback i recieved for last part of midterm...
	- "Forward direction: You should instantiate player p explicitly by using "consider", "let", etc. Also, you should structure the proof so to prove that any player p is a tournament champion rather than start out by assuming that they are and then check the "requirements".
	- but this was on a proof for biconditional...i think? So for the first part, I proved that any arbitrary p in an RPS tournament is a champion...

- [ ] regrading pset 3?
	- [ ] 6.iii we messed up the intuition, but shouldn't we still get partial credit for execution or readability? (like we did in 5.ii - messed up intuition, but got partial for readibility ) - max +2 oof no nwm

- [ ] read guide to FOL Translations
- [ ] "How to read and write proofs" by daniel solow (not necessary)

- extra practice
	- [ ] ec problems from pset1
	- [ ] ec problems from pset 2
	- [ ] ec problems from pset3
	- [ ] ec problems from pset 4

- concept confusions
	- [ ] the relationship between universal statements, implication and the and operator
		- (from guide to negations) ![[Pasted image 238.png]]
		- (from notes 6/29) ![[Pasted image 239.png]]
	- [ ] i don't get what more is needed to define vars/which var needs to be defined
		- ![[Pasted image 608.png]]

### Assign 4
- [ ] any way to do 2.ii with only one base case? / shorten this
