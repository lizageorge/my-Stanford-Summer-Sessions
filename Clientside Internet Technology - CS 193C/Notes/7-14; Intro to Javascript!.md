## The Javascript Programming Language

### Javascript Uses
- JS is *the* client-side programming language, most common use of JS (there are dozens of languages for server-side, but basically just one for client-side)
	- client-side alternative languages
		- java is supported on most modern browsers, but its a huge security risk
		- most other languages are translated into JS through a **transcompiler**
			- Typescript (JS isn't a typed language, TS requires type on JS)
			- Dart (a language from google, allows classes)
			- Coffeescript 
- There are libraries and frameworks that are build on top of JS (React, Angular, Vue)
	- JQuery - designed to handle the differences between browsers (this issue was much worse a few years ago when IE was super different, nowadays not as popular)
