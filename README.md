# my-Stanford-Summer-Sessions
Over the next two months, I will be taking a few Computer Science-focused courses in Stanford Summer Sessions High School Summer College. I've decided to upload my work and track my progress here as I go through my first ever college-style classes!
I will not be including any individual answers in this public repository (nothing that a future student could use to cheat - unfortunately, this does include most of my work). Nor will I be including anything that isn't public on Stanford's websites (so a lot of starter code, class ppts and videos, etc.).
